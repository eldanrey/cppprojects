/*
A 4th grader is having trouble with Permutation and Combination problem in Mathematics, 
so a friend offered help to create a program they can use. The program contains 3 options, 
1st option is for Permutation, 2nd option is Combination and 3rd is for terminating the system.
For option 1, Permutation, they uses the following formula: nPr = n!/(n-r)! ; where r must 
not be greater than n. It should not proceed if this condition is not met. For 2nd option, 
Combination, they uses the formula : nCr = n!/r!(n-r)! ; where r must not be greater
than n as well. For the 3rd option, the program ownerâ€™s information shall be displayed, 
like name, subject code and account number, before the program terminates.
